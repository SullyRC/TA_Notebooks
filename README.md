# TA_Notebooks
A collection of Google Colab Notebooks created to introduce data science topics to students in DTSC 3601/3602. These notebooks are not part of the course material, but were created for the purpose of introducing students to topics that they might not have encountered yet. 


## Notebooks
- [Pandas](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ykL6XHby_y3qWPqFRlsG68wlXmw6x5Ws?usp=sharing): Notebook that introduces the pandas package and some practical uses for data wrangling.
- [Classification Intro](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1aW2x5RlATCQCkcWo4DETYCZfo-FHPEGo?usp=sharing): Notebook that introduces classification problems and some data prep techniques associated with tackling classification problems. Also briefly goes over the different types of machine learning.
- [Boosting Models](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1MZGSzR2p9bqPb9xjCctIhRUxfhlCYeT5?usp=sharing): Notebook that introduces boosting as a topic from a high level. Goes over what boosting is and how it works as well as working with a gradient boosting model using XGBoost.
- [Time Series](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WTRmssBFKoDEGrT0s22c7eQrokqmDXtG?usp=sharing): Notebook that introduces Time Series problems. Briefly goes over topics such as seasonality, auto-correlation, and stationary time series. Introduces ARIMA, DGLM, and LSTM models for Time Series and utilizes them for 1-day out predictions of Nvidia stock price.
